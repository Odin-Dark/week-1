# Intro to HTML!

## Your terminal and GitHub steps are [here](https://github.com/hw-studio-fall17/practice-week-1)
#### Open the week-1 folder in sublime. Notice the files named: `mr-whiskers.html` and `spot.html`.

#### Inside `mr-whiskers.html`
---
1. Type `html` then press tab to get your base HTML code. 
2. Add an `<h1>` tag that says: MEOW, my name is Mr. Whiskers.
> All of the header tags in HTML start with an h plus a number (1-6). EX: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
3. From the command line write `start mr-whiskers.html` to see your code in Google Chrome.


#### Inside `spot.html`
---
1. Type `html` then press tab to get your base HTML code.
2. Add an `<h1>` that says: WOOF, my name is Spot.
3. From the command line write `start spot.html` to see your code in Google Chrome.


#### Extensions
---
1. Add some more headers to `mr-whiskers.html`. Use headers with different numbers: `<h2>`, `<h3>`...
2. What happens when you use bigger numbers after the `<h`?
3. Look at some more HTML tags on this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp).

4. Click on the `<p>` tag on that [website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) and read about `<p>` tags. What do they do?
5. Click on the Try it Yourself button to see how `<p>` tags work. 
6. Add a `<p>` tag that explains how Mr. Whiskers is feeling today. 
7. Open your page in Google Chrome to see your new code! (Or just refresh the page if it's already open).
8. Choose another NEW tag from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) and add it to the `spot.html` file. 
> *** HINT: `<a>` will help you make a link on your website and `<ol>` will help you make a list with numbers!
9. After writing your new code open your page in Google Chrome to see your new code! (Or just refresh the page if it's already open)
